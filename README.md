# Huffman_Encoder
A simple implementation of huffman encoding. Can encode and decode simple text files of large and small sizes.

Implementation is a little hacky, but works and does form a bitstream and is capable of producing ~40% compression.
The program current is designed to be run from the command line, where the source file can be specified. 
The good stuff however is simply located in the CompressionManager class, if you're just interested in gutting this project for the compression.
